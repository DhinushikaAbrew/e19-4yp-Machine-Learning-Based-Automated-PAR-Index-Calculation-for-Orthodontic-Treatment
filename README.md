# Machine-Learning-Based-Automated-PAR-Index-Calculation-for-Orthodontic-Treatment
___

## Introduction
Orthodontic treatment plays a vital role in correcting misaligned teeth, and improving both oral health and facial aesthetics. However, evaluating the success of these treatments remains a challenge, as current assessment methods rely heavily on the manual examination of pre- and post-treatment dental models. While experienced orthodontists can accurately perform these evaluations, less experienced practitioners, including residents and newly qualified professionals, may struggle with subjectivity and inconsistency. This can lead to errors in determining treatment effectiveness, particularly when using standardized assessment tools such as the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index.

<!-- Although automated PAR Index calculation tools exist, their high cost makes them inaccessible to many individual practitioners and smaller clinics. This lack of affordability creates a significant barrier to standardizing orthodontic treatment evaluations, limiting the adoption of objective assessment tools in everyday practice. -->

This project aims to address these issues by developing a cost-effective and accessible software tool that automates PAR Index calculations using 3D orthodontic study models in .stl format. The proposed system offers several key benefits:

### Objectivity and Consistency
> By eliminating human subjectivity, the software ensures accurate and reliable orthodontic assessments.
### Accessibility
> A publicly available or affordable tool that democratizes standardized evaluation methods, making them accessible to all practitioners.
### Efficiency
> Automating the evaluation process reduces the time and effort required for assessment, allowing orthodontists to focus on patient care.
### Enhanced Learning
> The tool provides objective feedback based on predefined PAR Index criteria, helping early-career orthodontists improve their evaluation skills.
